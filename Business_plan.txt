Got it — you’re essentially asking how to evaluate the business potential of a game idea in a specific genre, based on market trends, audience interest, and revenue potential. Let’s break it down into a practical, step-by-step market analysis process tailored for the video game industry.

1. Define Your Objective Clearly
You’re not just “researching the market” — you’re answering:

Is this genre growing or shrinking?


Who is the audience, and how big is it?


What’s the realistic revenue potential for a game like this?


2. Identify & Quantify the Market

Genre Popularity Trends: Use tools like Steam Charts, Google Trends, Twitch viewership stats, and YouTube search volume to see if interest is rising.


Market Size: Look at industry reports (e.g., Newzoo, Statista) for total revenue in your target genre/platform.


Platform-Specific Data: PC, console, and mobile markets behave differently — mobile genres like puzzle or idle games have different economics than PC shooters.


3. Analyze the Competition

Direct Competitors: List top-selling or most-played games in your genre.


Performance Metrics: Check concurrent player counts, review counts, and estimated sales (SteamSpy, VGChartz, App Annie).


Gaps & Opportunities: Look for underserved niches — e.g., a genre with high demand but few high-quality titles.


4. Understand the Audience

Demographics: Age, location, spending habits.


Psychographics: Why they play — competitive thrill, story immersion, social interaction.


Engagement Channels: Where they hang out — Discord, Reddit, Twitch, TikTok.


5. Estimate Revenue Potential

Pricing Model: Premium, free-to-play with microtransactions, subscription.


Monetization Benchmarks:


Premium indie PC game: $10–$30, with sales spikes during discounts.


Mobile F2P: ARPU (average revenue per user) often $1–$5/year, but whales can skew results.


Sales Forecasting:


Look at similar games’ sales and adjust for your marketing budget, quality, and differentiation.


Example: If a comparable indie sold 200k copies at $20, but you have half the marketing reach, you might project 50k–100k copies.


6. Factor in Development & Marketing Costs

Development Budget: Salaries, art, sound, tools, licenses.


Marketing Spend: Influencer outreach, ads, events.


Break-Even Analysis:

7. Risk & Trend Analysis

Genre Saturation: Too many similar games can make discovery hard.


Trend Lifespan: Some genres (like battle royale) exploded but became crowded quickly.


Platform Policy Changes: App store rules, Steam algorithm shifts, console certification.

If you want, I can mock up a quick example market analysis for a hypothetical genre — say, cozy farming sims or roguelike deckbuilders — so you can see exactly how the numbers and insights come together.
